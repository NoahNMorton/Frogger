# Frogger
A school project recreating the famous game, Frogger.

#How to play:
WASD to control your frog, get all frogs onto lilypads to win. You lose a life if you touch a car, or fall off a log or turtle. Turtles will rise and sink in the water, and can only be stood on if they are above the water's surface. 

If you lose all your lives, you will lose the game. Losing a life will set you back to the start or middle.
